// The shared editor-CLI contract.
//
// VENDORED FILE. A byte-identical copy lives in the sibling editor CLI. The two
// packages deliberately do not share code - they ship and version separately,
// and a shared dependency would break the zero-dependency rule both of them
// keep. What they do share is a contract, and this file is it.
//
// It exists because of what happened without it: the two CLIs drifted into
// opposite refusal contracts (stdout and exit 2 in one, stderr and exit 1 in
// the other), disagreed on whether a flag was required or defaulted, silently
// swallowed unknown flags, and one of them folded them into the message text.
// Every one of those was invisible to both green suites, because each package
// only ever tested itself.
//
// So this suite asserts behaviour through the CLI, never implementation. Either
// package may satisfy it however it likes. When it changes, it changes in both
// copies in the same sitting - that is the whole discipline, and there is no
// mechanism enforcing it beyond this paragraph.
